# zomato_data_analysis_machine_learning
Zomato Data Analysis using machine learning in Python investigates restaurant trends by analyzing user reviews, ratings, and attributes. It employs libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn to derive insights, predict customer preferences, and optimize recommendations, ultimately enhancing the user experience on the Zomato platform.



## Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to set up and execute a Zomato data analysis project using machine learning in Python, without including any code.

Step 1: Install Python

1. Download Python**: Visit the official Python website and download the latest version suitable for your operating system.
2. Install Python**: Follow the installation prompts, ensuring you check the option to add Python to your system PATH.

Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal**: Access the command line interface on your computer.
2. Create a virtual environment**: This helps to manage project-specific dependencies.
3. Activate the virtual environment**: This isolates your project from other Python projects.

Step 3: Install Required Libraries

1. Install necessary libraries**: Use a package manager like pip to install libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Step 4: Download the Zomato Dataset

1. Obtain the Dataset**: Find the Zomato dataset from sources like Kaggle or Zomato's API, and download it in CSV format.

Step 5: Create the Analysis Script

1. Create a new Python file**: Name it appropriately for your project.
2. Open the file in a code editor**: Use an editor like VSCode, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook to write your analysis.

Step 6: Load and Preprocess the Data

1. Load the dataset**: Import the dataset into your analysis environment.
2. Data cleaning**: Check for and handle missing values, duplicates, and any necessary data type conversions.

Step 7: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Visualize the data**: Use various plots to understand the distribution of ratings, the relationship between features, and other insights.
2. Summarize findings**: Document any trends or anomalies you observe in the data.

Step 8: Prepare Data for Machine Learning

1. Feature selection**: Identify which columns to use as features and which to use as the target variable.
2. Split the data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Step 9: Train the Machine Learning Model

1. Choose a model**: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your analysis, such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Logistic Regression.
2. Train the model**: Fit the model using the training data.

Step 10: Evaluate the Model

1. Make predictions**: Use the trained model to predict outcomes based on the test data.
2. Assess performance**: Evaluate the model's accuracy and other performance metrics.

Step 11: Review Results

1. Analyze the output**: Examine the accuracy and any classification reports to understand how well your model performed.
2. Visualize results**: Create visualizations to present your findings clearly.
